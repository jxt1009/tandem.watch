4. Click **"Load unpacked"** button (top left)

## Option 2: Drag & Drop .crx File

If you have a `dist.crx` file instead:

1. **Open Chrome** and go to **`chrome://extensions/`**
2. Turn ON **"Developer mode"** (top right toggle)
3. **Drag the `dist.crx` file** onto the extensions page
4. Click **"Add extension"**

⚠️ **Note:** Chrome will show a warning saying "not listed in Chrome Web Store"—this is normal and harmless for personal extensions. You can safely ignore it.

✅ **Done!** The extension is installed and working.
